**A top-grade AI Agent for intelligent resume search and talent matching.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

The Resume Search Agent is a powerful, AI-driven application designed to revolutionize the talent acquisition process. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and vector database technology (ChromaDB), this agent enables recruiters and hiring managers to semantically search through vast resume datasets, moving beyond traditional keyword matching. It features an intelligent ingestion pipeline for processing resumes and a robust search mechanism that understands context and intent, making it an indispensable tool for efficient and accurate candidate discovery.

## ✨ Features

-   🎯 **AI-powered Semantic Search**: Perform intelligent searches on resumes based on skill, experience, and contextual understanding rather than just keywords.
-   🧠 **Agent-based Query Refinement**: Utilize AI agents to interpret complex search queries and dynamically refine search parameters for more accurate results.
-   📄 **Resume Data Ingestion**: Efficiently parse, embed, and store resume data into a vector database for quick and scalable retrieval.
-   📊 **Vector Database Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with ChromaDB for high-performance similarity search and data management.
-   🚀 **Scalable API Backend**: Built with FastAPI, providing a robust, high-performance API for all agent functionalities.
-   🛠️ **Configurable LLM Integration**: Easily configure and integrate with various LLM providers for embeddings and agent reasoning.
-   🌐 **Separate Frontend**: Designed for flexibility with a decoupled frontend for user interaction.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Python** (3.10 or higher recommended)
-   **pip** (Python package installer)
-   **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ambrose-kutti/Resume-Search-Agent.git
    cd Resume-Search-Agent
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Mac use `source venv/bin/activate`
   
    ```

3.  **Environment setup**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory for your environment variables.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env # If .env.example exists. Otherwise, create manually.
    ```
    Configure your environment variables in the newly created `.env` file:
    ```
    # --- LLM Configuration ---
    
    OLLAMA_BASE_URL = http://localhost:11434         # URL where Ollama is running
    EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text                 # Run: ollama pull nomic-embed-text
    
    # --- ChromaDB Configuration ---

    CHROMA_COLLECTION = esumes                       # Name of the ChromaDB collection that stores resume vectors
    CHROMA_DB_PATH="./chroma_db"                     # Path where ChromaDB will store its data (local persistent storage)
    
    # --- Backend API Configuration ---
    #  API 
    # Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins
    # Use * for local development only. In production, set your real domain.
    # Example: https://yourdomain.com,https://admin.yourdomain.com
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5000,http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```
    *Adjust the LLM-related variables based on your chosen LLM provider.*

4.  **Database setup**
    ChromaDB will initialize automatically on first use at the specified `CHROMA_DB_PATH`. No manual migration commands are typically needed for local ChromaDB instances.

5.  **Ingest Sample Resumes (Optional but Recommended for Testing)**
    The `generate_resumes.py` script can be used to generate synthetic resumes and ingest them into the system.
    ```bash
    python generate_resumes.py
    ```
    This script might require additional dependencies, please check its internal imports.

6.  **Start the backend development server**
    Navigate to the root of the project and run:
    ```bash
    uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
    This assumes your main FastAPI application is defined in `api/main.py` and the app instance is named `app`.

7.  **Start the frontend development server**
    The `frontend` directory contains the web UI. Please refer to its specific `README.md` or package manager instructions for setup.
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    # Example for a Node.js-based frontend (e.g., React, Vue, Angular):
    # npm install
    # npm run dev
    # cd .. # Go back to root directory
    ```
    *Note: The specific commands for the frontend will depend on its chosen framework and build tools. Please consult the `frontend/` directory for details.*

8.  **Open your browser**
    Once both backend and frontend are running, visit `http://localhost:[detected_frontend_port]` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for React/Next.js) to access the application. The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses environment variables for sensitive information and configuration. These are loaded from the `.env` file using `python-dotenv`.

| Variable        | Description                                       | Default        | Required |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`| API key for OpenAI services (embeddings, LLM calls)| -              | Yes      |
| `LLM_PROVIDER`  | (Optional) Specify alternative LLM provider       | `OPENAI`       | No       |
| `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`| API key for HuggingFace models (if `LLM_PROVIDER` is `HUGGINGFACE`)| - | No |
| `CHROMA_DB_PATH`| Local path where ChromaDB will persist its data   | `./chroma_db`  | No       |
| `FASTAPI_HOST`  | Host for the FastAPI server                       | `0.0.0.0`      | No       |
| `FASTAPI_PORT`  | Port for the FastAPI server                       | `8000`         | No       |

### Configuration Files
-   `config.py`: This Python file contains application-specific settings, constants, and potentially default values for various components (e.g., LLM model names, embedding dimensions, search parameters). It centralizes non-sensitive application configurations.

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts (Backend)

-   `uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`: Starts the FastAPI development server with auto-reloading.
-   `python generate_resumes.py`: Executes the script to generate and possibly ingest synthetic resume data.

### Development Workflow
1.  Ensure all prerequisites are met and dependencies are installed.
2.  Set up your `.env` file with necessary API keys and paths.
3.  Start the backend API server.
4.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory and follow its instructions to start the frontend development server.
5.  Make changes to the respective backend or frontend codebases. The backend will hot-reload on changes.

## 🧪 Testing

No explicit testing framework or test files were detected in the top-level directory structure. For a production-grade application, it's highly recommended to implement unit and integration tests for both the backend API and AI agent logic.

**Recommendation:**
-   For Python backend: Use `pytest`.
-   For frontend (if JavaScript-based): Use `Jest` or `React Testing Library`.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Build (Backend)
To create a production-ready deployment for the backend, you would typically use a WSGI server like `Gunicorn` in conjunction with `FastAPI`:
```bash
gunicorn api.main:app --workers 4 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Deployment Options
-   **Docker**: It is highly recommended to containerize both the backend and frontend applications using Docker for consistent and reproducible deployments. A `Dockerfile` for the FastAPI application would typically be placed in the root or `api/` directory.
-   **Cloud Platforms**: The backend can be deployed on various cloud platforms like AWS EC2, Google Cloud Run, Azure App Service, or Heroku.
-   **Frontend**: The frontend can be built and served as static files (e.g., on Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any static file hosting).

## 📚 API Reference

The backend API is built with FastAPI, providing automatic interactive API documentation using Swagger UI (OpenAPI).

### Accessing API Documentation
Once the backend server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:
-   **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
-   **Redoc**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`
